I have preached that the purified content of understanding in all dependent co-arising, in sustenance, in the realms, in recollection, in true severance, in the supernatural abilities, in the factors of awakening, and in the factors of the path is the truth of ultimate meaning.This purified content of understanding is characterized as being of one taste, being undifferentiated in all the aggregates, in all the bases, in all they discussed [above], for it is of one taste and not differentiated. It is from this principle that the truth of ultimate meaning is of one universal taste.</div>

The selflessness of the teaching of suchness and ultimate meaning is based upon the nondual wisdom of suchness and ultimate meaning. They then will come to awareness and realize the truth of ultimate meaning, which is of one universal taste. Therefore, Subhuti, from this principle understand that the truth of ultimate meaning is of one universal taste.</div>

And, if they arose from causes, they would themselves be conditioned. And, if conditioned, they would not be ultimate meaning. And, if they were not ultimate meaning, then one would once more have to seek the truth of another ultimate meaning. It is because suchness, ultimate meaning, and the no-essence of all things are not said to be caused, do not arise from causes, and are not conditioned that they are the truth of ultimate meaning. Once one attains this ultimate meaning, there is no further need to seek another ultimate meaning. Only it is eternal and permanent, whether a Tathagata appears in the world or not, for in all things reality is established, the reality realm perdures. Therefore, Subhuti, from this principle you should understand that the truth of ultimate meaning is of one universal taste.</div>
